# Pigment Sandbox

Small sandbox to generate that use the Pigment library. You can use is to generate colors that matches together

## Installation

The sandbox is based on symfony.
Just deploy is as any simple symfony app

```

You don't need any database.

I use Symfony UX -> Turbo to enhance the user experience. Don't forget to build you assets

```
